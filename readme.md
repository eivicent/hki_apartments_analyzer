# HKI Aparment Analyzer

This is a personal project with 2 aims: **learning and practical application**

#### Practical application

- The practical application is buying a small appartment in Helsinki area for personal use. 
- I would like to understand better how pricing works in different neighbourhoods and conditions of the apartment.
- Once I can have a high-level visualization of what is going on, I would like to be able to TAG them and filter them in a better way than the real-state mobile app

#### Learning purposes
- As learning purposes, I would like to practice with `rvest` package for getting the data
- Building a `shiny` application and practice the use of _modules_
- Use the package `pins` to handle the data pipeline
